# Outline SDK Mobileproxy

This repository provides pre-compiled binaries of the Outline SDK Mobileproxy library for Android and iOS. See the [Outline SDK](https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-sdk/tree/main/x/mobileproxy) for the library's source code.

> [!WARNING] 
> The github repository has moved to `timas130/mobileproxylib`. This shouldn't break existing users with pinned versions, but you will need to update the dependency location to upgrade to the latest version.

## Integration

### Android

We use JitPack to distribute the Android library. To integrate it into your app, follow these steps:

1.  Add it in your root `settings.gradle` at the end of repositories:
    ```groovy
	dependencyResolutionManagement {
		repositoriesMode.set(RepositoriesMode.FAIL_ON_PROJECT_REPOS)
		repositories {
			mavenCentral()
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
    ```
2.  Add the dependency to your app's `build.gradle` file:
    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation 'com.github.timas130:mobileproxylib:<version>'
    }
    ```

### iOS

You can add the Mobileproxy to your Xcode project using Swift Package Manager.

1.  In Xcode, go to **File > Add Package Dependencies...**
2.  Enter the package repository URL: `https://github.com/timas130/mobileproxylib`
3.  Select the desired version.
